Since I realized that Next.js and Express.js are essential for modern web development, I decided to practice and learn these frameworks on my own. This project aims to connect with MongoDB to support planning and classification for my family's business. Below is a breakdown of my design:

Assigning Tasks on a Calendar: Includes a Post-it feature to announce all important information.
Job Board Creation: Allows assigning responsibilities to each person, with the ability to upload critical images related to each job for accuracy.
Image Storage: Stores crucial project-related images in a database, which can be used for generating beneficial documents like reports, especially for jobs related to customer guarantees or other important projects.
Frameworks Used:
Express.js: For API development and JWT authentication.
Next.js: For frontend display // include with Riv animation .
MongoDB: For data storage.
This project is still a work in progress, but I hope to complete it soon.
